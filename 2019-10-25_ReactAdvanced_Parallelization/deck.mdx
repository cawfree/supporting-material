# Today's Talk...

## ‚ö° Threading.

  - Devices are becoming increasingly _parallel_.
  - Users have _high expectations_ of native apps.

# ‚ò†Ô∏è  Pick your Poison.

  - **Native Code** (Objective C, Java, etc.)
    - Highest performance, highest complexity.
  - ** Delegate** to a `<WebView />`
    - Simple, subject to browser fragmentation.
  - **Hybrid Containers**
    - Performant threaded JavaScript.

<Notes
>
  - **Native Code**
    - Can be tuned and thoroughly optimised to take full advantage of the capabilities exposed by the native runtime.
    - Imposes both development and test complexity, which scales linearly with the number of platforms you intend to target.
    - Not to mention requires compliant implementations of bridge protocol for all runtimes.
